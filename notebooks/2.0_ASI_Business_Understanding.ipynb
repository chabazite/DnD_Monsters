    "While the Monster Manual has hundreds of monsters ready to go, sometimes it isn't enough and you, as the dungeon master need to create your own monsters. However, using the guide provided by 5e wizards, somehow never lines up for myself or other DMs the way the challenge rating in the monster manual does. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Dungeon Master's guide, a challenge rating (CR) is made up primarly from the Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, damage output per round, and the save DC. It ends up being an average of these items, and cross-referenced to a CR chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Resistances and Immunities come into play, adding multipliers to the hit points\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as average damage per round, the dungeon master's guide and wizards themselves indicates that a combat should last roughly 3 rounds. The DMG suggests averaging 3 rounds of combat to calculate the average damage per round.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of party composition (this will matter for some AOE, range or aura based attacked), we will assume a standard party of four: 2 close combat and 2 ranged, Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Cleric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monster Features also impact the challege rating of a monster either through the armor class, hitpoints, attack bonus, or damage output for purposes of determining the CR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spell casting is important. If a spell causes the monster to deal more damage than a normal attack routine or if it increases the monster AC or hitpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a monster can fly and deal damage at range it's armor class goes up by 2 if its CR is below 10\n",

The folks at WotC put a lot of time, energy, creativity, and play testing into these monsters. I don't think that is something you can just spit out with a simple formula. That being said, it does get pretty close, so it should be worth considering when creating your own monsters."
