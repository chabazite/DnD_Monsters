    "# DnD Monsters: Dice and Data\n",
    "As a Dungeon Master, it is very important to understand the strength of the monsters you pit against your players. Too weak, they are bored, too strong, they die or worse..they don't have fun. The current method known as Challenge Rating, CR, is a numerical system used to determine how difficult an enemey is based on a party of 4 players. Challenge Ratings range from 0 to 30. Unfortunately, this method is very basic and often times does not actually hold true to every encounter. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that isn't accounted for is action economy. This is the biggest detroyer of players, the strongest weapon in your arsenal. If your players are facing 100 monsters, that's 100 turns. Even if you manage to kill a good chunk of them, the majority will make it through and some of them...with critical hits. Thus is a much more difficult encounter than an equally XP worthwhile monster, with say 2 attacks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Wizards of the Coast not only provide a guideline for how much XP you should have per level per day, but they also show you how much a party of 4 at X level can stomach during one encounter. They also provide an XP multiplier that takes multiple monsters into consideration. For example, 10 monsters get a x2.5 XP multiplier, causing their total XP rating to jump up for the encounter, potentially making them deadly. Action Economy rules all. \n",
    "\n",
    "CR is unfortunately not a great method for measuring a monster's strength. It uses AC, HP, attack bonus, damage per round and Save DC as a general guideline. It doesn't take into account legendary action, at will spells, special abilities that cause status ailments, or any other boosting abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two CRs: Defensive and Offensive, used to calulate the total CR of a monster. Using the chart provided you find the average of the CR indicated by the HP and AC. Offensive does the same thing but uses DPR and Attack Bonus. Then by averaging the two CRs we get our final monster Challenge Rating. As you can see this doesn't take into account any of the strong abilities a monster may have. Similarly, you may have a weak physical monster that uses spells that is vastly lower in CR than it should be. \n",
    "\n",
    "WoTC has augmented this system by applying multipliers or increases based on other features, trains, or abilities the monster may have. \n",
    "\n",
    "www.dndbeyond.com/monsters has many pages of monster listings. Each listing has a dropdown that has a monster table associated with it. This contains stats, abilities, and other important details. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, dndbeyond has shut down its ability to scrape through automation detection software. I don't intend to break to ToS, so I will use the SRD from the dandwiki.com page instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this investigation is to learn more about Monster's abilities in relation to the CR system. To understand if there are corellations in any of the stats, abilities, environments, size, etc. To see if we can classify monsters based on any of these traits. To create a dashboard that pits monsters against each other to compare. Finally, to see if there is a way to better address the CR system and use abilities, traits, features, and spells in a more cohesive manner \n"

    "First we need to gain access to our monster data sheet. as stated above, dndbeyond.com has a great repository of monster data. This will need to be scrapped from there site. Unfortuntately, each of the monster pages is hidden behind an accordion dropdown and will need to be extracted. This is something I have not yet done, so I am excited to try. We will start out using Requests and BeautifulSoup since I am most comfortable with these."
