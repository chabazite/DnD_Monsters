    "# DnD Monsters: Dice and Data\n",
    "As a Dungeon Master, it is very important to understand the strength of the monsters you pit against your players. Too weak, they are bored, too strong, they die... or worse..they don't have fun. The current method known as Challenge Rating, CR, is a numerical system used to determine how difficult an enemey is based on a party of 4 players. Challenge Ratings range from 0 to 30.\n",
    "\n",
    "CR uses AC, HP, attack bonus, damage per round and Save DC as a general guideline. Unfortunately, it doesn't fully take into account legendary actions, at will spells, special abilities that cause status ailments, or any other boosting abilities. It's pretty tuned into attack and defensive type behaviors. That makes sense too, because they are the most translatable into an equation, which WotC has done for us (I showed this in the previous notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this investigation is to learn more about Monster's abilities in relation to the CR system. To understand if there are correlations in any of the stats, abilities, environments, size, etc. To see if we can classify monsters based on any of these traits. Finally, to create a basic app that can predict a monster stat and trait block based on inputs such as party level, difficulty, monster type, environment, and alignment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to stay within WotC terms of service, we will only work on monsters that are part of the SRD. "
